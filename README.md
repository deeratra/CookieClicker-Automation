# CookieClicker-Automation

Here is a simple Pyhton script for the Cookie Clicker game by DashNet, Playsaurus.
I am using Selenium for clicking on the cookie.

How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository on your local IDE
2. You need to have Python installed on your computer
3. You can download the selenium from the pip library
4. Download the driver of the browser that you are using.
5. Update the path of your driver in the PATH variable.
6. Click on Run

Customization

You can customize this by increasing the range. I have set it up uptil 1000. You can
increase it even further.

Reference 
The code is inspired from the https://www.techwithtim.net/ youtube videos.
